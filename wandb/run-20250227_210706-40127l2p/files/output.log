C:\Users\msocz\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Lib\site-packages\huggingface_hub\file_download.py:142: UserWarning: `huggingface_hub` cache-system uses symlinks by default to efficiently store duplicated files but your machine does not support them in C:\Users\msocz\workbench\oliveai\trend-evalute\hf_cache\hub\models--deepseek-ai--DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Caching files will still work but in a degraded version that might require more space on your disk. This warning can be disabled by setting the `HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS_WARNING` environment variable. For more details, see https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/how-to-cache#limitations.
To support symlinks on Windows, you either need to activate Developer Mode or to run Python as an administrator. In order to activate developer mode, see this article: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development
